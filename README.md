## 📌 Overview

**Reserve Bite** is a complete restaurant reservation platform that connects **users**, **restaurant owners**, and an **admin**. Built with Flutter and Supabase, it demonstrates real‑time data sync, role‑based access, and a clean, maintainable codebase.

- **Users** can browse restaurants, book tables for specific dates/times, and manage their reservations.
- **Restaurant Owners** log in to view and respond to booking requests (accept/decline).
- **Admins** manage the restaurant listings – add new restaurants or remove existing ones.

The project follows **MVC architecture** with **GetX** for state management, routing, and dependency injection, and uses **custom reusable widgets** for a consistent UI.
